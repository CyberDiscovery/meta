# meta
This repository is for meta discussion of the Cyber Discovery Discord server. https://discord.cyberdiscoverycommunity.uk

## Usage
If you have any problems with the server, or aspects you think should be changed, make an Issue! For any suggestions, improvements, or solutions to current Issues, just make a Pull Request. Discussion can then occur in this repository, among server members and admins. When making a PR, you may find it helpful to refer to or edit some of the server files, such as [CHANNELS.md](/CHANNELS.md), [ROLES.md](/ROLES.md) or for other suggestions (e.g. emojis or more general changes), [MISCELLANEOUS.md](/MISCELLANEOUS.md). After a PR has been approved, it will go into the Discord server to be voted on, to assess its popularity before potentially being implemented.

## Code of Conduct
This repository is for serious suggestions to the server, and we expect all suggestions and discussion to be made respectfully. We welcome differing opinions and debate, but please make sure that this is done inoffensively. Be welcoming, inclusive, respectful, empathetic and constructive, and the whole process will be much smoother.
