# Cyber Discovery Community Discord Meta Repository

This repository is for meta discussion of the Cyber Discovery [Discord server](https://discord.cyberdiscoverycommunity.uk).

## Code of Conduct

This repository is for serious suggestions to the server - we expect all suggestions and discussion to be made respectfully.

We welcome differing opinions and debate, but please make sure that this is done inoffensively. Be welcoming, inclusive, respectful, empathetic and constructive, and the whole process will be much smoother. ðŸ˜„

## Usage

We understand that the meta repo can be somewhat confusing, so here's exactly how to use it:

### Making Issues

If you have any problems with the server, or aspects you think should be changed, make an Issue! Make sure no one has addressed the issue you have in another issue or PR before making it - if not, you can do the latter by:

1. Navigate to the `Issues` tab.
2. Click on the `New issue` button in the top-right corner.
3. Follow the template prompt and describe the issue.
Following comments and actions by the Admin Team or server members on the issue, one can then make a PR if a consensus has been achieved or the issue seems popular.

### Making PRs

For any suggestions, improvements, or solutions to current Issues, just make a Pull Request. Follow these steps:

1. Fork the `meta` repository.
2. Edit the necessary files for your issue on the fork.
3. Once done, navigate to the `Pull requests` tab.
4. Click on the `New pull request` button in the top-right corner.
5. Describe the changes you've made and submit it.

Discussion can then occur in this repository, among server members and admins on the PR created. After a PR has been approved by the Admin team, it will go into the Discord server to be voted on, to assess its popularity before potentially being implemented.

### Keep those suggestions coming in - the server can be improved with your ideas right here
