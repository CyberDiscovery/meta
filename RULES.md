Swearing is allowed so long as it isn't directed maliciously at another member.

If you aim something at another member intended as a joke and they do not take it as so, just apologise and move on.

Do not discuss any illegal activity on the server - remember that people's lives and careers have been impacted by messing with the wrong people or activities when they were young.

There may be situations not covered by the rules or times where the rule may not fit the situation. If this happens, the moderators are trusted to handle the situation appropriately, and reserve the right to take action as they see fit. 

If you have a complaint about a staff member, you can DM a complaint to another member of staff.
