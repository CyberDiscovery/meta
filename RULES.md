Swearing is allowed so long as it isn't directed maliciously at another member.

If you aim something at another member intended as a joke and they do not take it as so, just apologise and move on.

Do not discuss any illegal activity on the server - remember that people's lives and careers have been impacted by messing with the wrong people or activities when they were young.

There may be situations not covered by the rules or times where the rule may not fit the situation. If this happens, the moderators are trusted to handle the situation appropriately, and reserve the right to take action as they see fit. 

If you have a complaint about a staff member, you can DM a complaint to another member of staff.

## Discriminatory Content
Discriminatory content is not and never will be condoned on the server. This means ALL racist imagery or remarks posted by anyone on the server is sufficient grounds for punishment by a moderator. This is not up for debate - offensive content is not allowed on this server in any form. If you are upset or offended by racist or derogatory content posted on this server, DM a moderator immediately. If you are unsure if your content 'counts' as offensive, do not post it, and DM a moderator if you want clarification.

## Doxing
1. Do not expose any personal information about person A without express permission from person A ANYWHERE, on or off the server.
2. Personal information is any info pertaining to person A’s identity, e.g. locations, names, contact details - anything that is linked to that person.
3. If you’re not sure whether it counts as doxing, simply DO NOT SAY IT. Ask the person in question FIRST. 
4. If you want to release your own personal information PUBLICLY ON THE SERVER, feel free to, but be aware that it can be RE-QUOTED AT ANY TIME as YOU have made it freely available. If there’s something that you accidentally posted or something you want deleted, delete it or let a mod know so that appropriate action can be taken.
5. Don’t try to find information that can dox someone else. Ask their permission or leave it. It’s not worth the risk of ruining someone else’s/your time on the server.
